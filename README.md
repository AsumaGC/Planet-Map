# PixelCanvas minimap

A minimap repository for the website PixelCanvas.io. This one aims to be available to everyone, instead of focussig on one particular faction. Note though, no templates that are against the rules of PixelCanvas.io will be added, so don't request pornographic imagery, swastikas, or similar stuff that's not appropriate to be put onto a public website. Requesting and approval of templates will be handled by the PixelCanvas Council server and its staff members for now; if you don't know about that one, ask a representative of your faction who might be there, or contact the current server owner, Low Quality#0091 (ID: 328239338271801345).

### Important note
Due to copyright issues, the actual script had to be taken down from the repository, and won't be available anymore without explicit consent of it's original creator. Ask around the Discord servers to find out more about that.

If you installed the script previously, it will still work perfectly fine, as updates to the templates are done by change of the files outside of the script, which remain in this repository.
