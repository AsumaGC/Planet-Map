# PixelCanvas minimap

A minimap script for the website PixelCanvas.io. This one aims to be available to everyone, instead of focussig on one particular faction. Note though, no templates that are against the rules of PixelCanvas.io will be added, so don't request pornographic imagery, swastikas, or similar stuff that's not appropriate to be put onto a public website. Requesting and approval of templates will be handled by the PixelCanvas Council server and its staff members for now; if you don't know about that one, ask a representative of your faction who might be there, or contact the current server owner, Low Quality#0091 (ID: 328239338271801345).

### Setup

#### Step 2: Install the UserScript by opening this link

In case you don't get an install dialog, or find the script overwriting/being overwritten by other minimaps in Greasemonkey (since they got the same file name), do the following:
- Find any other script that's not a PixelCanvas minimap, and install it.
- Open the minimap.user.js file that is the minimap script you'd like to install, and copy its entire content.
- Click the Greasemonkey icon, and select the random script from before. Choose "Edit" and paste the minimap script content over whatever was there before. Don't forget to save (Ctrl+S)!
- The script should now show up with the intended name, and work properly. This way you can install multiple minimaps, you just need to make sure that only one is active at a time, as they'll conflict with each other.
